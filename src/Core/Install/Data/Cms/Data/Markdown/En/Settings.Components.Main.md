##### Components

Views can have many components.  
Components are the building blocks of a view.  
Components are template files and can exist of both javascript, html & R3m code.  
For at least each template file, a template class is generated.  
Actually it generates a template class when detecting {{literal}}"{{"{/literal}} symbols in the document.
